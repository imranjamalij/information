Google Scholar

Kinshuk

University of North Texas

SunWolf
Professor of Communication

As you can see, you are not alone. All these professors seem to be using their (single) name in publications. (No doubt there are others too, who have a single name, but use variant forms in publications.)

(Edit: These examples, along with examples of professors who have the same first and last names, are collected on the Improbable Research blog.)
